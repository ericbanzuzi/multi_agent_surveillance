# UM Project 2-2 Group 17: Multi-Agent-Surveillance

This repository contains a multi-agent system designed for guarding and intruding an unknown area.
This research delves into the application of various algorithms to simulate the behaviour of intelligent intruders and guards. 
The primary algorithms implemented include A*, Heuristic Lowest Unknown-Degree Search, Brick and Mortar, and Lee Exploration.

## Application information

The application can be run, as a Gradle project, from the Main class, and will automatically prompt a menu window. 
The program will use three different pre-defined maps provided for exploration and for guards vs intruders. 
The Simulation class offers a way to run multiple simulation without visualizations.

**Requirements:**
- Gradle 7.0.1 or higher
- JavaFX 17 or higher
- Java JDK 11 or higher
